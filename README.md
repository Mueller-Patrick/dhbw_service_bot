**DHBW Service Bot - WIP**

This is a telegram bot for students at DHBW Karlsruhe.
In the future, it will be capable of things like automatically sending you the daily menu in the 
canteen in the morning or informing you when your first lecture will begin the next day.

To use it, go to `t.me/dhbw_service_bot` and follow the given instructions.

This bot is programmed and run by

`https://github.com/Mueller-Patrick`

and

`https://github.com/qt1337`.

To contribute, follow the steps in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

<br><br>
Used libraries are <br>
`requests`<br>
`requests_html`<br>
`datetime`<br>
`json`<br>
`asyncio`.<br>

These are not specifically important for development, just for us to run the bot.
To install them, run `pip install [LIBRARY_NAME]`on your machine, given that you have already installed pip.

We also used the `os` library, but this should come with vanilla python.
